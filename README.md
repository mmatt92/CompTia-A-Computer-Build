  <h1>CompTia A+ Computer Build Lab</h1>
    <h2>Build Steps</h2>
    <p>For this build, we're using the components shown in the list and gallery above. Your build will likely differ slightly, but most of the steps below are universal and will look and function very similarly.</p>
    <h2>Parts used: Motherboard, CPU</h2>
    <p>If you're yet to choose one, here's our guide to the best CPUs for gaming. Got it? Now, remove your gaming motherboard from its anti-static sleeve and place it on a clean, flat surface. Remove the protective plastic covering over the CPU socket on the motherboard by pushing the lever arm down and to the side, then pulling the covering up. Now you're ready to install the processor.</p>
    <p>Open your CPU box and take the processor out. It's probably safely housed in a plastic sleeve. Look at the CPU and match the arrow on the bottom-left corner of the chip with the bottom corner of the socket. There are also two notches on the top half of the chip. The pins face down, so the plain silver side should be facing up. There's only one possible way to correctly orient the CPU, which makes it easy to install.</p>
    <p>The CPU fits into the socket, and you don't need to press down to force it into place. It doesn't 'snap' inâ€”it just rests on top of the pins. To finish the installation, simply lower the socket covering and push the lever arm back into place.</p>
